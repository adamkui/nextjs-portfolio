  "CAREER_BODY": "My professional programming journey started when I joined General Electric in 2017, as a Robotic Process Automation Developer (RPA) intern. ü§ñ I met, and also did programming before, but even though RPA is not the typical write lines of code technology, I fell in love with learning programming. üë®‚Äçüíª I quickly realised that being a programmer is something I absolutely love, and what I can do passionately. I started to become more and more motived, and in a few years I became a senior level RPA developer. üë¥ However, I felt like I had much more in me, and I really wanted to learn something new. So, in 2020 I started to look for new opportunities, when I came across frontend development. I just fell in love with it. üòç I've spent about 1.5 years coding 8-12 hours after work, during the nigth, 5-6 times a week, working on hobby projects while I was studying from online courses. First just HTML and CSS, then JavaScript, and then TypeScript, frameworks, and a bunch of libraries. As a result, I got my first job as a Medior Frontend Developer in 2021. Nowadays I mostly enjoy working on React and Next.js projects, and in the future I definitely want to learn other frontend frameworks (Angular and Vue), mobile development, and who knows what else the future will bring! ü§ì",
