  "CAREER_BODY": "My journey started when I joined General Electric in 2017, as a Robotic ü§ñ Process Automation Developer (RPA) Intern.  I met, and also did programming before, but even though doing RPA is not a tipical 'write code in an IDE' job, I fell in love with learning programming. üë®‚Äçüíª I started to become more and more motived, and in a few years I got to a senior üë¥ level in RPA. However, I felt like I had much more in me, and I really wanted to learn something new. So in 2020 I started to look for new opportunities, when I came accross frontend development. I quickly fell in love üòç with it. I've spent more than a year coding 8-12 hours after work during the nigth, working on hobby projects while I was studying from online courses. First just HTML + CSS, then JavaScript, and then only frameworks and a bunch of libraries. Today I mostly enjoy working on React / Next.js projects (like this website). For the future I definitely want to learn more about SSR, other frontend frameworks (Angular and Vue), and who knows what else the future will bring! ü§ì",
